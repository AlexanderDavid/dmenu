# Alex's dmenu
Based off of [Luke Smith's build](https://github.com/LukeSmithXYZ/dmenu).

This is just my build of dmenu. Nothing special, don't bother starring ;)

## Changes
- GruvBox theme
- Transparency
- Optional border
- Optional centering

## Installation
After making any config changes that you want, but `make`, `sudo make install` it.
